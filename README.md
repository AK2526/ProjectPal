Running the Client
===========

Use npm to download all the files and run a react app as usual. More information is available in the official react readme inside the client folder.

Running the server
===========
Ideally, create a virtual environment, and install all the packages in requirements.txt inside the server folder using pip. Run the server.py file. Also, add a security.py file for api keys.
